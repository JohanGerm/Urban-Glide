Client Payment OTP Example

Place this file in a folder served by your server (or open via file:// and change fetch URLs to the server address).
- Use the Initiate Payment form to trigger OTP generation (server logs OTP if Twilio not configured).
- Use the Verify OTP form to verify and authorize the payment.
